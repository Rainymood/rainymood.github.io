# Hi. I'm Jan.

I'm a **machine learning engineer/data scientist that loves building digital products.**

I do this through a combination of machine learning, data science, behavioral insights, and product design.

I code, draw, and love to think deeply about tools, systems, and our place in them. 

My favorite quote is this one:

>"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." - Arthur C. Clarke

- machine learning engineer
- data scientist
- product software engineer

I care deeply about:
- Solving people's problems using tech
- Teaching while learning
- Making the world a better place

I am obsessed with:
- Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning
- Software engineering (i.e. writing good code)
- Personal productivity and efficiency

Where I've studied:
- MPhil in (Advanced) Econometrics from the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home)
