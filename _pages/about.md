Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Meppe and I am a Machine Learning Engineer at
[Snappet](https://www.snappet.org/). 

I write about **how to become a better machine learning engineer**.

If you are in the machine learning field and want to talk tech, career,
or productivity, consider this my [standing invitation](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/): I want to talk to you
:). 

I love meeting new people and making new friends over the internet. Find me on twitter at [@Janmeppe](https://twitter.com/Janmeppe).

That being said... I love machine learning, but what really *really* drives me
is my obsession for **data-driven decision making:**

* I used data-driven decision making to become **one of the best 500 players in Europe** in a game called [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/) (that's the *0.0012%th percentile performance*)
* I used data-driven decision making to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube in **under 15 seconds**
* I used data-driven decision making to reduce a client's CI/CD build times **by a factor 3x** resulting in significant cost savings

I write because I like it and because I can help people at scale:

* I have written more than 50 articles on my blog [www.janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/)
* I wrote more than 150 editions of my sort-of daily (but now discontinued) newsletter [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/).
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) featured one of my blog posts on their front page and was read more than 30.000 times.

I built an iPhone app that is live on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en) and wrote about what I learned:

* [View 3 good things: a gratitude log on the App store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en)
* [Simple React Native Redux counter example

* [How to add a bottom modal in React Native
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-bottom-modal-react-native/)

I also make micro-tutorials so that I can save other people the headaches that I experienced setting up this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) + [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) blog:

* [How to remove the excerpt from recent posts in a minimal mistakes blog](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item/)
