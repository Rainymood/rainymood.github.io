Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Meppe. I'm a machine learning engineer that is passionate
about building consumer tech products. I am based in Amsterdam.

I make productivity tools:

* [Daily Productivity](https://janmeppe.substack.com/) is a daily newsletter focused on making you more productive. I compile the best self-help advice and turn it into an easily digested daily newsletter. 

I code:

* I do machine learning stuff in **Python** with **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Numpy**.
* I do web stuff in **JavaScript** with **React**, **React-native**, and **Node.js**.

I write:

* I write a daily newsletter about what I've learned today: [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/). In 2020 I published 37 editions of TJL. 
* I also write on my blog [www.Janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/). In 2020 I published 23 blog posts and in 2019 I published 7. 
* One of my blog posts was featured on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) and was read more than 30.000 times.

My most popular blog articles are tutorials:

* [Regex For Noobs (like me!) - An Illustrated Guide](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/regex-for-noobs/)

I [love meeting strangers on the internet](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/). So if you want to talk about: startups, tech, data science, productivity, management, leadership, notetaking, or zettelkasten, don't hesitate! Say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Janmeppe) for example!

I currently work as an AI consultant in the Amsterdam office of
[Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/nl-nl/) ([a Fortune
200 firm](https://fortune.com/fortune500/)) helping our clients use the power of AI.
