Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Meppe and I am a Machine Learning Engineer at
[Snappet](https://www.snappet.org/). 

Snappet is an EdTech startup building the future of eduction. It's flagship
product is an online learning platform for primary schools. Through working on
Snappet provided tablets we provide our pupils a way of learning core
competencies in math and language through our adaptive and AI-driven educational
platform. Prior to this, I was a data scientist for a Fortune 500 company.

I am passionate about using data to make better decisions. 

I *obsessively* collect data and turn them into results. For example I, 

* Used data science to reduce a client's CI/CD build times by 67% resulting in significant cost savings
* Used data science to become one of Europe's top 500 players in Overwatch (top 0.0012% performance)
* Used data science to figure out how to solve a Rubik's cube in <15 seconds

I code:

* I do machine learning stuff in **Python** with **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Numpy**
* I do web stuff in **JavaScript** with **React**, **React-native**, and **Node.js**

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utv_GYHvGBNxgESQV14KaLHvbMk5COme7LNIu5yaxl8/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of some of the technical things that I've worked on. 

I write:

* I write a sort-of daily newsletter, [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/). In 2020 I published 37 editions of TJL. 
* I also write on my blog [www.Janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/). In 2020 I published 23 blog posts and in 2019 I published 7. 
* One of my blog posts was featured on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) and was read more than 30.000 times.

I am currently learning React-Native to build native apps:

* [Simple React Native Redux counter example

* [How to add a bottom modal in React Native
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-bottom-modal-react-native/)

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) using the [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme which I heavily tweaked and write about as well:

* [How to remove the excerpt from recent posts in a minimal mistakes blog](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item/)
* [How to change size of blog posts](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/personal-blog-minimal-mistakes/)

* [How to add Latex to Minimal Mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/How-to-add-mathjax-to-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to change Jekyll theme to Minimal Mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-change-theme-to-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to add a teaser image to minimal mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/add-teaser-to-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to add a splash image to minimal mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-splash-to-minimal-mistakes/)
