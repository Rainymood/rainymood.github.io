Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Meppe and I am a Machine Learning Engineer at
[Snappet](https://www.snappet.org/).  I blog about **how to become a better machine learning engineer**.

## I love data-driven decision making

That being said... I love machine learning, but what really *really* drives me
is my obsession for **data-driven decision making:**

* I used data-driven decision making to become **one of the best 500 players in Europe** in a game called [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/) (that's the *0.0012%th percentile performance*)
* I used data-driven decision making to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube in **under 15 seconds**
* I used data-driven decision making to reduce a client's CI/CD build times **by a factor 3x** resulting in significant cost savings

## I write a lot 

I write because I like it and because I can help people at scale:

* I have written more than 50 articles on my blog [www.janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/)
* I wrote more than 150 editions of my sort-of daily (but now discontinued) newsletter [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/).
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) featured one of my blog posts on their front page and was read more than 30.000 times.

## I also build mobile apps...

I built an iPhone app that is live on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en) and wrote about what I learned:

* [View 3 good things: a gratitude log on the App store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en)
* [Simple React Native Redux counter example
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/simple-react-native-redux-counter/)
* [How to add a bottom modal in React Native
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-bottom-modal-react-native/)

## I studied here

I studied econometrics (financial engineering) with a focus on machine learning: 

* MPhil in (Advanced) Econometrics from the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home)
* MSc in Econometrics from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en)
* BSc in Econometrics from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en)
