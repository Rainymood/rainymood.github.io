I'm machine learning / software engineer living in Amsterdam.

I code machine learning stuff in **Python** with **TensorFlow/Keras**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **numpy**.

I do web stuff in **JavaScript** with **React** on the front-end and **Node.js** on the backend.

I write about **technology**, **management**, and **productivity** on my blog here.
