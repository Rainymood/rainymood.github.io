Hi 👋

My name is Jan Meppe and I'm an Amsterdam-based data scientist / software engineer.

I am passionate about using data to make better decisions. 

I *obsessively* collect data and turn them into results. For example I, 

* Used data science to reduce a client's CI/CD build times by 67% resulting in significant cost savings
* Used data science to become one of Europe's top 500 players in Overwatch (top 0.0012% performance)
* Used data science to figure out how to solve a Rubik's cube in <15 seconds

I code:

* I do machine learning stuff in **Python** with **TensorFlow/Keras**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Numpy**
* I do web stuff in **JavaScript** with **React**, **React-native**, and **Node.js**

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1utv_GYHvGBNxgESQV14KaLHvbMk5COme7LNIu5yaxl8/edit?usp=sharing) is a list of some of the technical things that I've worked on. 

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1poMQpggzXVm8zrBWY9gzMqwAxgze5cH4-XVYDupI-AE/edit?usp=sharing) is my story grid, but you can't open this one ;)

I write:

* I write a sort-of daily newsletter, [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/). In 2020 I published 37 editions of TJL. 
* I also write on my blog [www.Janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/). In 2020 I published 23 blog posts and in 2019 I published 7. 
* One of my blog posts was featured on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) and was read more than 30.000 times.

I am currently learning React-Native to build native apps:

* [How to add a bottom modal in React Native
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-bottom-modal-react-native/)

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) using the [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme which I heavily tweaked and write about as well:

* [How to remove the excerpt from recent posts in a minimal mistakes blog](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item/)
* [How to change size of blog posts](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/personal-blog-minimal-mistakes/)

* [How to change Jekyll theme to Minimal Mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-change-theme-to-minimal-mistakes/)
