# Hi. I'm Jan.
I help companies make sense of their data.

I do this through a combination of data science, machine learning, behavioral
insights, and product design.

The best way to describe me would be a product-focused full-stack data
scientist (machine learning engineer).

I love programming in Python and JavaScript and love to tinker in new
technologies such as Go and Haskell.

That's me!

I see my self as a (in descending order of importance):
- problem solver
- data scientist
- machine learning engineer

I care deeply about:
- Solving people's problems using tech
- Teaching while learning
- Making the world a better place

I am obsessed with:
- Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning
- Software engineering (i.e. writing good code)
- Personal productivity and efficiency

Where I've studied:
