Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Meppe and it is my mission to **change the way that people learn**.

To fulfill that mission, I currently work as a machine learning engineer at an education startup called [Snappet](https://www.snappet.org/). 

Before that, I worked as a data science consultant for [Cognizant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant).

On this blog I write about anything that interests me, which is mainly education/learning, engineering, and productivity [(browse by tag)](https://www.janmeppe.com/tags/)

## I wrote some popular tech blog articles

Three popular (>20.000 reads) blogs that I wrote are:

* [Regex For Noobs (like me!) - An Illustrated Guide]({% post_url 2019-08-04-regex-for-noobs %})
* [How to add a new kernel to your Jupyter Notebook]({% post_url 2020-08-20-how-to-add-new-kernel-in-jupyter-notebook %})
* [How to set Python 3 as default on Mac]({% post_url 2021-01-20-how-to-set-python3-as-default-mac %})

## I love data-driven decision making

I believe that machine learning is just one expression of **data-driven decision making**:

* I used data-driven decision making to become **one of the best 500 players in Europe** in a game called [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/) (that's the *0.0012%th percentile performance*)
* I used data-driven decision making to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube in **under 15 seconds**
* I used data-driven decision making to reduce a client's CI/CD build times **by a factor 3x** resulting in significant cost savings

## I make tiny tutorials about AWS infrastructure 

* [How to deploy an AWS Lambda serverless function using AWS CloudFormation]({% post_url 2023-12-19-how-to-deploy-an-aws-lambda-serverless-function-using-aws-cloudformation %})
* [Building a REST API with AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda in Python]({% post_url 2023-12-18-building-a-rest-api-with-aws-api-gateway-and-aws-lambda-in-python-aws-tutorial %})
* [Automating cloud infrastructure using infrastructure-as-code]({% post_url 2022-04-29-show-your-work-create-testset-automation %})

## I write about things that interest me

I write because I like it and because writing can help people at scale:

* [Janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/) hosts 50+ of my blog posts
* [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/) contains 100+ editions of my now discontinued daily newsletter
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) featured one of my blog posts on their front page and was read more than 30.000 times.

## I made an iOS app in the past!

I built an iPhone app that was live on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en) and wrote about what I learned:

* [View 3 good things: a gratitude log on the App store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en)
* [Simple React Native Redux counter example

* [How to add a bottom modal in React Native
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-bottom-modal-react-native/)

## I write about how to set up a blog like this

I share what I learn setting up this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) blog with the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme:

* [How to remove the excerpt from recent posts in a minimal mistakes blog](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item/)

* [How to change Jekyll theme to Minimal Mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-change-theme-to-minimal-mistakes/)

* MSc in Econometrics from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en)
* BSc in Econometrics from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en)
