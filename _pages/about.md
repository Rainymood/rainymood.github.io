That being said... I love machine learning, but what really *really* drives me
is my obsession for **data-driven decision making:**

* I used data-driven decision making to become **one of the best 500 players in Europe** in a game called [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/) (that's the *0.0012%th percentile performance*)
* I used data-driven decision making to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube in **under 15 seconds**
* I used data-driven decision making to reduce a client's CI/CD build times **by a factor 3x** resulting in significant cost savings

I write because I like it and because I can help people at scale:

* I have written more than 50 articles on my blog [www.janmeppe.com](https://www.janmeppe.com/)
* I wrote more than 150 editions of my sort-of daily (but now discontinued) newsletter [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/).
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20608032) featured one of my blog posts on their front page and was read more than 30.000 times.

I built an iPhone app that is live on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en) and wrote about what I learned:

* [View 3 good things: a gratitude log on the App store](https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/3-good-things-a-gratitude-log/id1569794018?l=en)
* [Simple React Native Redux counter example
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/simple-react-native-redux-counter/)
* [How to add a bottom modal in React Native
](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-bottom-modal-react-native/)

I also make micro-tutorials so that I can save other people the headaches that I experienced setting up this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) + [Minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) blog:

* [How to remove the excerpt from recent posts in a minimal mistakes blog](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item/)
* [How to change size of blog posts](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/personal-blog-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to add a favicon to minimal mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/personal-blog-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to add Latex to Minimal Mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/How-to-add-mathjax-to-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to change Jekyll theme to Minimal Mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-change-theme-to-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to add a teaser image to minimal mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/add-teaser-to-minimal-mistakes/)
* [How to add a splash image to minimal mistakes](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/how-to-add-splash-to-minimal-mistakes/)
