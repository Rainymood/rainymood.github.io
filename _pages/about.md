# Hi. I'm Jan.

I'm a **software engineer/machine learning engineer/data scientist** that is obsessed with **building digital products.**

What I do: 

* I do machine learning stuff in **Python (Keras/TensorFlow/scikit-learn)**, and web stuff in **JavaScript (Node/React/React-native)**. Here's a link to my [Github](https://github.com/Rainymood/)
* I write about **technology, management, and productivity** on my blog here. Don't know where to start? Click [here](https://www.janmeppe.com/start/) for a list of my most popular articles.
