Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jan Meppe and welcome to my blog! I care deeply about **education** and it's my personal mission to change the way that people learn!

Right now I'm a **senior machine learning engineer** at [Snappet](https://www.snappet.org/) where I work on the ML infrastructure team, building tools and platforms that power personalized education.

Before that, I worked as a data science consultant at [Cognizant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognizant).

Before that, I studied econometrics with a focus on applying machine learning to econometrics. I hold an MPhil in Econometrics from the [Tinbergen Institute](https://www.tinbergen.nl/home), BSc and MSc degrees in Financial Econometrics from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

ðŸ’¡ New here? Go to [**Start Here**]({% link _pages/start.md %}) to view a curated list of my favourite posts organised by theme! 
{: .notice--info}

I write about four main things:
- **(ML) system design**: How do we build robust, scalable, and maintainable (ML) systems?
- **Software**: How do we build great software?
- **Learning**: How do we learn and get better at learning?
- **Product**: How do we craft products that people love?

You can also explore by [tag]({% link _pages/tag-archive.md %}), browse the [grid]({% link _pages/year-archive-wide-grid.md %}), view the [archive]({% link _pages/year-archive.md %}), or search in the top right.

Connect with me at `{first_name}{last_name}@gmail.com`. 

I love connecting with people who read my blog!

## I love data-driven decision making

I believe that machine learning is just one expression of **data-driven decision making**:

* I used data-driven decision making to become **one of the best 500 players in Europe** in a game called [Overwatch](https://playoverwatch.com/en-gb/) (that's the *0.0012%th percentile performance*)
* I used data-driven decision making to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube in **under 15 seconds**
* I used data-driven decision making to reduce a client's CI/CD build times **by a factor 3x** resulting in significant cost savings

## I make tiny tutorials about AWS infrastructure 

* [How to deploy an AWS Lambda serverless function using AWS CloudFormation]({% post_url 2023-12-19-how-to-deploy-an-aws-lambda-serverless-function-using-aws-cloudformation %})
