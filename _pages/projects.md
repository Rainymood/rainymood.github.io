**Description:** For a hackathon I built a front-end in React. Prior to this I
had never worked with React. I used this opportunity to stretch myself
technologically and force myself to learn React in only 3 days! It was
amazing to see how quickly you can create a web application with today's
technologies!

**Technologies:** JavaScript, React, Node

**Code:** [Github]()
