Here you can find my writings about startups.

- [What is a startup?]({% post_url 2021-07-08-what-is-a-startup %})

# Other resources

- [Startup = Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) Seminal article about what differentiates a startup from a regular company. Must read. 
- [Doordash removing equity cliffs](https://blog.doordash.com/aligning-reward-with-impact-an-update-to-our-equity-vesting-approach-96bf61d21eda) Interesting writing on equity cliffs. Can steal some of their PR fluff.
