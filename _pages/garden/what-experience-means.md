as you work you gain experience

but what does this mean

you are expected to bring in best practices

as you come into a new company or a new team 

so the key question is this: what did I learn at my previous job that I can apply here

you are being paid for your skills and expertise right now

it is important that you pay attention to current processes now and memorize them, or at least write them down

could I do this or explain this myself?

what *unique* things can I do now because of this experience

experience is about transferable skills

all i'm saying is this:

* pay attention to best practices now
* write them down or memorize them so you can refer to them later
