i love analogies and this is a great one 

> "Ultimately, programming is hard. Often, we are smart, so we succeed. TDD is there to help us out when weâ€™re not so smart. 

we can use the metaphor of lifting a bucket of water out of a well with a rope

when the well is not deep and the bucket isn't very full then it is easy

the point is that you get tired after a while 

**tdd is like having a ratchet that lets you save your progress, take a break, and makes sure you never slip backwards**

this way you don't have to be smart all the time
