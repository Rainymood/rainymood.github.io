# Jan Meppe's personal blog

This is Jan Meppe's personal blog. It is built with the [minimal
mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) jekyll theme.

Here be dragons.

## To run

```ruby
rake build
```

Because of a small unicode error/bug, see [this blog
post](https://www.janmeppe.com/blog/invalid-US-ASCII-character/) we build the
site using `rake build` instead of `bundle exec jekyll serve/build`

## To view draft posts

(This is included in the rakefile.) To preview draft posts, put **undated**
posts in the `_drafts/` folder and then build/serve jekyll with the `--draft`
flag.
