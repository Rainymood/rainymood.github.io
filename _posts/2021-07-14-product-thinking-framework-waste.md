In this blog post I want to share with you what I like to call a *product
thinking framework*, a way of coming up with new startup ideas. 

This product thinking framework is simple: **turn waste into something useful**.

# Too Good To Go

My favorite app in this category is [Too Good To Go](https://toogoodtogo.org/en)
which is the leading anti-food waste app.

For grocery stores, Too Good To Go provides a platform to sell food that is
edible, yet they aren't allowed to sell in the store due to the expiration date.

For consumers, Too Good To Go provides a platform to buy large quantities of
food that is still edible, yet near expiration date, at a huge discount.

Obviously this is a win-win for both parties. Grocery stores get extra revenue
by selling food their would otherwise throw away (literal food waste) and
consumers can pick up for for pennies on the dollar. Score!

# Transform waste

That's it. That's the whole idea: transform waste into something useful.

To get you started here are some questions you can ask yourself:

- Can you identify some form of waste?
- How can you turn this waste into something useful?
- What do you waste on a daily basis?
- What do you see other people waste on a daily basis?
- How can you leverage technology to do this better?
