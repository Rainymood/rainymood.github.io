Update time! Things happened while you were away: I got a new job, I went on a vacation,
and I got vaccinated! 

Let me know if you like these kind of update posts. I kind of stole this idea
from [Mac Wright](https://macwright.com/). In his
["Recently"](https://macwright.com/2021/07/01/recently.html) blog posts, he
writes about what happened in his life... recently. Almost like a *real blog*!

# New job!

First things first! I got a new job! Amazing!

I'll be starting as a machine learning engineer at an EdTech scale-up called
[Snappet](https://nl.snappet.org/). 

Snappet is building the future of education. They developed an online
learning platform for schools that provides personalized math learning for kids in primary school (the one before high school)

I am very excited to start at Snappet, because education is something that is
very close to my heart. Both my parents were teachers and ever since I
started working I told myself that I either wanted to work on EdTech or on
self-driving cars. So here we are!

There are a lot of things that I want to do:

- Do great work
- Set up a tech blog
- Challenge myself to talk with everyone in the company at least once in my first month
- Go out and talk with our users (kids, teachers, and school admins)

# Vacation

Went on a really really nice vacation in Spain where I also celebrated my 27th
birthday ðŸ¥³. My sister lives abroad in Spain so I visited her over the summer.
Went there for 10 days and did all sorts of fun things like you would do on
vacation: play sports, go the beach, and train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with my buddy
Max that I took with me on vacation.

# I freaking love flying

Going on vacation always (and I mean always) makes me realise how much I love
flying. Flying makes me feel so small and insignificant. Seeing everything from
above always forces me into this systems-level way of thinking, seeing the world
from a different, broader, perspective, and I love that.

# Lost all motivation to work on my app

![](/../assets/2021-07-04-update/2021-07-05-18-21-47.png)

After publishing my app to the app store I seem to have lost *all* motivation to work on it. 

The problem, at least that's how it's in my head right now, is that it is "finished". I *know* in my head that there is a lot more stuff that can be done, but the momentum is gone. I moved on to other things. On the flip side, I did use my app while I was on vacation and I learned many lessons from using my own app: 

- The importance of push notifications to reel someone back in 
- The importance of having to form habits for people to come back
- That some things are just "natural" once they are in your hand, make your app act that way
- That after having built the product, everything else is marketing 
- You really have to *sell sell sell* your app every day, because who else is going to?

# I got vaccinated

I got jabbed with the Pfizer vaccine. If I start to turn magnetic, you guys will be the first to know.
