I want to share this story because it contains a powerful systems insight that took me a couple of re-reads to get.

Donella Meadows writes in Thinking in Systems:

> Early on in teaching about systems, I often bring out a Slinky. In case you grew up without one, a Slinky is a toy—a long, loose spring that can be made to bounce up and down, or pour back and forth from hand to hand, or walk itself downstairs.

The central insight is that **the behaviour of a system is often times latent/hidden/stored within the structure of the system** and is not necessarily caused by the things we think it causes.

Yes the hand or the box do manipulate or suppress some of the behaviour, but that behaviour is caused by the structure of the slinky (system). 

She continues: 

> When it comes to Slinkies, this idea is easy enough to understand. When it comes to individuals, companies, cities, or economies, it can be heretical. **The system, to a large extent, causes its own behavior!** An outside event may unleash that behavior, but the same outside event applied to a differ- ent system is likely to produce a different result.

 She reasons through some of the pretty wild implications if you ask me:
