Recently I migrated my whole blog from the Cayman theme to the Minimal Mistakes theme, which can be found [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). This blog post explains how to quickly get up and running with the Minimal Mistakes theme.

**Before**

Setting this is up is ridiculously simple if you know what you're doing. I am making this blog post because I want to save people the headache of spending a whole day debugging something they don't actually have to because they followed the wrong instructions.

This post assumes that you are going to run your blog using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com). Note that you can only have 1 Github pages repo that points towards `<username>github.io`, all other Github pages are going to point towards `<username>github.io/<repo-name>`.

## Step 1. Fork the minimal-mistakes starter repo

Go to the Minimal Mistakes Github pages starter [found here](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter) and fork the repo.

## Step 2. Change the repo name

Click on `settings` and change the repository name. I chose to rename the repo to `minimal-mistakes`.

**Option 1** If you rename the repo to `<username>.github.io` then your Github pages will be hosted on `<username>.github.io`. For me this becomes `rainymood.github.io` which can be found [here](https://rainymood.github.io).

**Option 2** If you rename it to anything else, say `minimal-mistakes`, then your Github pages will be hosted on `<username>.github.io/<repo-name>`. For me this becomes `rainymood.github.io/minimal-mistakes` which can be found [here](https://rainymood.github.io/minimal-mistakes).

## Step 3. That's it!

**It's that simple.**

Don't be like me and waste a full day debugging something you don't actually have to. Just fork the repo and start publishing!

This is what the final product looks like and you can find it [here](https://rainymood.github.io/minimal-mistakes).
