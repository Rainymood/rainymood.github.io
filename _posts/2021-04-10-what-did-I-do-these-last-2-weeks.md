What did I really do these last two weeks?

What *output* did I really produce? 

That's the question that I'm trying to answer for myself right now. 
As a seasoned data scientist there's only one way to figure out... collect more data!
To gather data I tracked my output every day on a post-it note like this:

Without further ado, this is what the data shows!

## Version 3 of RemindMe

Design and code for RemindMe (v3).

I am building an app to make the most out of your positive feedback. It is an app that allows you to save/record your positive feedback and then periodically reminds you of it. It's first working name was Praise, now it's RemindMe.

## 32 handwritten morning pages

Wrote 32 morning pages. 

I've been writing so-called [morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/), "three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing." It's usually the first thing I do when I wake up. I grab a cup of coffee and (hopefully) before getting sucked into the dark corners of the internet I try to fill three pages of writing. 

So 32 pages of stuff like this:

## Publishing my Jupyter notebooks as notes

Published 11 Jupyter Notebooks as [notes](https://www.janmeppe.com/notes/).

We should get better at data science the more we do it, in other words [knowledge work should accrete](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Knowledge_work_should_accrete). But I feel like I often google things that I *feel like I should know already* (i.e. how to do a grid search on a scikit-learn pipeline). To remedy this I want to create, host, and maintain an online repository of code notebooks that I find personally valuable and often reuse.

## Registered Flashcardlabs.com

Registered [Flashcardlabs.com](http://www.flashcardlabs.com/). 

The plan is to turn it into a blog about how to lead a better life by thinking better. That means I have to write content about how to think better, study better, act better, beat procrastination etc.

## Sent out 14 TJLs

Sent out 14 versions of my newsletter [Today Jan Learned](https://janmeppe.substack.com/). 

I haven't been posting every religiously and I'm not too happy with the
quality of my writing the last couple of weeks. I need to either plan better
or devote more time to it.

## Drive around Easter break

Had a nice motorcycle trip over the Easter weekend.

## A nice stew

I also made a nice stew? I realised that all good cooking takes is good ingredients, lots of spices, and *time*.

# Conclusion

So yeah... that's what I've been up to these last two weeks. 

Still don't feel like I did enough though.
