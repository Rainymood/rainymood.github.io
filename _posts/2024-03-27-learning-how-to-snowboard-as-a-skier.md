In this blog post I want to share my experience learning how to snowboard as a skier. I go skiing every year or so but I never snowboarded and I thought now would be the perfect time to learn it. I love learning and learning how to learn and I thought that this would be a great time for me to learn a new skill.

I prepared like anyone would prepare for anything: **by watching a lot of YouTube videos**. 

Yup.  That’s all I did. Here’s a sample of my notes.

I think the biggest thing that I learned from skiing that transferred to snowboarding is that you should really **commit to the turn**. 

If you go, you go for it, no half-assing. With skiing this means that you must take some speed down and then push through to finish the turn. With snowboarding this means that you should lean into the turn and trust the snowboard to grip the edge.

All this watching of Youtube videos really paid off and I was able to do a red slope on my first day of snowboarding which was pretty neat. I’m not going to say it was pretty, but I got down the slope with some turns.

As a bonus picture here is me falling in some powder snow.

I guess I did not commit enough to the turn!
