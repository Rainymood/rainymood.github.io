Three micro-productivity tips that work for me:

1. **⏰ Timebox it**: In this case, I gave myself 20 minutes for each task and wrote down how much time it took me to complete it. [60/20] means I wanted to do it in 20 but it took me 60 minutes.
2. **✍️ Write it down**: Striking through a word or filling in a checkbox is very satisfying. It also has the nice effect of staring you in the face if you keep the booklet open in front of you.
3. **✅ Make it a game**: This is basically the same as the first tip, but viewing it as a game that you can win triggers something in me that makes it very motivating to get things done.
