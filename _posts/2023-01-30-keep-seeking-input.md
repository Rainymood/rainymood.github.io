This is another lesson that I learned building machine learning systems. For the other lessons that I learned click [here]({% post_url 2022-12-21-lessons-learned-from-building-machine-learning-systems %}).

Imagine that you're like a little machine with some *inputs* and *outputs*.

And your job as a machine is to generate the correct output.

It sounds obvious, but **if you do not get the right inputs, it's impossible to get the right outputs.**

Therefore, it's your job as a machine to figure out what inputs you need to make these correct outputs. 

What do you need to go from this:

To this:

What inputs does the machine need to create the right outputs? 

And there's NO shame in getting these inputs! For example this could be: asking
for more direction, or asking for technical help on a coding problem, or asking
for some time to ask some validating questions.

Do whatever you need to get the right inputs to create the right outputs.
