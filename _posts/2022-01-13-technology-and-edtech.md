It's no secret that many of our teachers are overworked and undervalued. While
this is a systemic problem, I do believe that we can help to alleviate some of
the burden on our teachers by using technology in the right places. 

By leveraging technology at the right place at the right time in the
classroom we can truly unburden our teachers and allow them to do what they are
best at: educating our children.

Full disclose: I work as a machine learning engineer for Snappet. Snappet is a
tablet based educational platform for primary schools. Schools that use Snappet
technology have students make exercises on tablets, we collect this data,
process it, and try to use it to maximize a student's learning.

I never meant for this to become a stealth ad for Snappet, but I just started
thinking through all the ways that Snappet makes lives easier for the teacher
and students, and that's how I came up with this blog post.

<!-- Personalisation. Another promising part where technology can help is personalised lesson plans. The assumption that the order of exercises in the textbook is the most optimal order for every student is quite strict and in my opinion outdated and quickly violated. Even more strongly worded, technology can be used to figure out the exact best order for students, or perhaps there is none. But by using technology we can personalise the lesson plans and create a more effective learning solution for everyone.  -->

## Better teachers

**Technology is transforming the way teachers teach.** The first way technology
can be leveraged is with the teachers. Technology can provide teachers with
live and actionable insights into classroom and individual student behavior.

For example, this is the live dashboard that every teacher has when he or she
uses Snappet. With this dashboard she gains immediate insights into which
students are thriving and which students are struggling. Using this dashboard
she can then more effectively intervene and support where is really necessary.

**Technology is transforming the way students learn.** The second way technology
can be leveraged is with the students. Technology can provide them accurate
insights into their own performance and how they are doing relative to their
peers.

For example, this is the learning objective status that we show to the students.
This bar shows you how you are doing and how much practice you still need to
have completed this learning objective. This gives students ownership over their
skills and gives them information on what they still need to practice!


## Better content

**Technology is transforming the way we think about content.** The third and final way technology can be leveraged is through serving the right content. Using big data and smart algorithms we can create better content for our students. If every student makes a certain exercise correct, does that mean that all students are wrong or is the content just unclear? Furthermore, by gathering data on which students finds which exercises difficult we can use smart algorithms to serve exactly the right questions to the right student to maximize their learning! 

## Conclusion

All in all, I think that technology is one of the ways that we can really
transform education in a positive way. I only touched upon three different
perspectives in this blog post (teachers, students, content) but of course there
are many more. If you found this interesting be sure to visit our website or
