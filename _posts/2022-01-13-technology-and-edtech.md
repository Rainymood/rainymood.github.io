It's no secret that many of our teachers are overworked and undervalued. While
this is a systemic problem, we can alleviate some of this burden by creating
technology for the classroom. This can save time for teachers and have them do
more what they are best at: educating our children.

The honest truth is I came up with this blog post because I was curious where Snappet
(the company that I work for) adds value in the classroom. I just kind of
started brainstorming where and how we add value in the classroom and what you
read is the result of that. 

[Snappet](https://us.snappet.org/) is an edtech company that provides a
tablet-based learning solution for primary schools in subjects like math and
language. We are currently based in The Netherlands,
Spain, and the US. What we do in a nutshell is this: We provide the school with
the tablets and software for kids to learn, I then specifically capture all this
data, do smart things with it, and try to make these kids learn as much as
possible :).

Are you a data scientist / data engineer / machine learning engineer with a
passion for education? Apply now at [Snappet](https://us.snappet.org/). We are
always looking for technical talent with a heart for education.

Anyway, let's get cracking! Where does technology add value in the classroom?

## Better teachers

**Technology is transforming the way teachers teach.** The first way technology
is transforming education is by changing how teacher teach. In contrast to traditional education, technology has the added benefit of being able to provide
teachers with live and actionable insights into classroom and individual student behavior.

For example, this is the live dashboard the teachers see when they teach a
lesson through Snappet.  Green dots indicate correct answers of students and red
dots incorrect answers.  With this dashboard, teachers get immediate feedback
and insights into which students are doing well and which students could use a
little more support.  The beauty is that using these insights teachers can more
accurately support those students that really need it. 

## Better students

**Technology is transforming the way students learn.** The second way technology
is transforming education is by changing the way that students learn. Technology can provide them accurate
insights into their own performance and how they are doing relative to their
peers.

For example, at Snappet we have this thing called the learning objective
indicator. A learning objective is a skill that we expect you to master at
some point (say, the tables of 10). For each of these learning objectives we
show this learning objective indicator as a running blob. This way the student
knows exactly which learning objectives he has mastered and which need some
additional work (orange). 


## Better content

**Technology is transforming the way we create and serve content.** 
The third and final way technology is changing education is through the content itself.
We can now use big data and smart algorithms to 1) create the right content and 2) serve the right content to the right student.

Consider the exercise above (just forget that it is in Dutch). Imagine that we see that *every* student makes this exercise wrong, does that mean
that all those students are wrong? Or that the content is just unclear?  Using
these kind of insights we can create better content, filter out bad content, and
serve the right content to the right student at the appropriate difficulty
level!

## Conclusion

All in all, I think that technology is beautiful in the sense that it allows us to do more with what we already have. 
Whether we like it or not, technology is going to transform the educational space and we need to make sure that it is in the
benefit of all of us, but most importantly to the benefit the children that we educate.

In this blog post I touched upon three different perspectives on how technology can add
value to teachers, students, and study material they learn from.
I hope you found this interesting and feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat or brainstorm about this :)
