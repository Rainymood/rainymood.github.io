At the end of each year I summarize how the year went, reflecting on how I progressed towards my goals. Here are the previous editions of this article:

- (2022) [A year of reflection](www.google.com)

### How did I progress against my goals


### Growth

Look back at where I was at the start of this year and where I am now I see a lot of growth. I see a lot of technical growth and a lot of personal growth.

I grew technically both in perspective and in skill set. I can attribute this growth almost entirely to a new colleague joining in february. By sheer virtue of being around him I was motivated and inspired to learn more about things like domain driven design. More importantly I was able to immediately apply them in the context of what we were working on, and that really helped cement the lessons. I also picked up a second programming language [golang]() near the end of the year. Having two programming languages allows you to compare adn contrast them. 

I grew personally a lot as well, through work I got in contact with a coach and she helped me work through some stuff. She mainly prodded deeply and asked annoying questions that no one had asked me before in a conversation. 

### Change 

When I reflect on this year I see a lot of changes, both personal and professional. Professionally a new colleague joined in February which was really great. I learned a lot from him and he totally changed our team dynamics in a positive way. At the end of the year I had the opportunity to switch teams internally which also was a big change. Personally, I moved in with my girlfriend and we have a cat now. 

### Fun

This year was also a lot of fun for me. I think that fun is important. Fun is important to me. I moved in with my girlfriend and that has been a lot of fun, my day to day life is now so different, different in ways I could not expect. I have a cat now which is great. This is also a lot of fun and it's like having a tiny baby, it's really fun but also takes a big toll on you.

### Lessons learned

* **Start the day with some work** I learned that my prime hours are in the morning, just as you wake up. It is tempting to start with opening your phone and checking the news but I learned this year that I can also just start with some work. This sets you up for success in the rest of the day
* **It is OK to make mistakes** I learned that the optimal amount of mistakes is not zero. If you take some risk then sometimes you will make a bad decision, this is inevitable if you take some risk every now and then. It is often better to be wrong and get corrected than it is to take no action at all
* **The bottleneck is where it piles up** I learned that in any system where there is an excess queue (i.e. half finished blog posts) that is the bottleneck, and to improve the output of the system you must intervene at where the bottleneck is, the constraint. That is systems design.
* **The human mind forgets** I learned that I am very forgetful. I have this weekly review  habit where I do a quick scan of what happened throughout the week on Friday and scrolling through it now I see a lot of things that I forgot that had happened. I need to keep this weekly review habit is great.
