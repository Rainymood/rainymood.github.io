All good design flows from these 7 stages of actions and the 3 principles of discoverability, feedback, and the conceptual model:

* A user wants to achieve something (goal) against a state of the world   
* To do this, the user needs to a) figure out what is possible and b) figure out how to do this (discoverability)
* Then, the user takes action on this and gets feedback on these actions (feedback)
* Finally, the user interprets this feedback and incorporates it into her conceptual model of how the product works (model)

And the cycle repeats, starting with new goal-setting.

While reading the [CFAR handbook](https://rationality.org/files/CFAR_Handbook_2021-01.pdf) I realized that these 7 stages of actions map neatly to the [OODA loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) we already know and love: 

>United States Air Force Colonel John Boyd was a fighter pilot and theorist who developed a model of decisionmaking called the OODA loop.
> 
> Essentially, Colonel Boyd’s theory was that people are constantly looping through the same four steps as they interact with their environment:
>
> 1. Observe—Sometimes also called the “notice” step, this is the point at which you become aware of something which might require your attention. For a fighter pilot, this might be a flash of light on the horizon. For everyday life, this might be something like hearing a crash come from the kitchen, or seeing an expression flicker across your partner’s face.
> 2. Orient—This is the point at which you frame your observation, and decide how you will relate to it. Is this a problem to solve? A threat to avoid? Something unimportant that you can dismiss?
> 3. Decide—This is the point at which you formulate a plan. What will you do, given the ongoing situation? How will you respond?
> 4. Act—This is the point at which thinking pauses (until your next obser-
vation) and you move toward executing the plan you’ve already formed.

The image on the left shows the 7 stages of action and the image on the right shows the same graph but the stages of OODA superimposed on top of the image.

I could not not join in on the hype... so here's a ghiblicore picture of me!
