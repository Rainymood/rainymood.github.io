All good design flows from these 7 stages of actions and the 3 principles of discoverability, feedback, and the conceptual model:

* A user wants to achieve something (goal) against a state of the world   
* To do this, the user needs to a) figure out what is possible and b) figure out how to do this (discoverability)
* Then, the user takes action on this and gets feedback on these actions (feedback)
* Finally, the user interprets this feedback and incorporates it into her conceptual model of how the product works (model)

And the cycle repeats, starting with new goal-setting.
