Writing is easy. Writing *well* is hard. 

The problem is that writing well is much more than writing. It’s writing, re-writing, re-re-writing. It’s editing, thinking, and mulling over the words. It’s reading the same sentence over and over again and rewriting it 20 times. It’s about taking the time to let the writing sit and simmer and then to make it pop and come alive. Good writing takes effort to create but feels effortless to read.

*… luckily for you I distilled a quick shortcut to good writing in three basic steps!*

Cycle through these three steps to make your writing so irresistible that it will be impossible for people to put down your writing. Just… make sure to not skip step 2 otherwise you will create clickbait.

I present to you the **Write-Streamline-Sexify system**:

1. **Write**: The first part of the system is generation. This is the part where you just get words out on the paper. Call it creation, word vomit, ideation. Or just: Writing. Get the words out on paper.
2. **Streamline**: The second part of the system is streamlining your message. What is it that you want to say? Take your text and pare it down to its bare essentials. Can you say it in one word, in one sentence, or in five sentences? Streamline your message to its most essential form: the core message.
3. **Sexify**: The third part of the system is sexifying your writing. Try to make its expression fun, sexy, or informative. Do anything to make it juicy. Add numbers, facts, images. Make it big or make it tiny. Add examples, add stories, add anecdotes. Basically add juice. Make your writing so compelling it would be crazy for the reader not to read it.

The sad truth is that no one really cares about your writing until you make them care. It's not the reader's job to care, it's the writer's job to make them care. What's in it for them? What do they gain out of it? Why is this worth their attention? You have to make your writing so compelling that it would be stupid of them *not* to read it.

This is also the reason why clickbait works. Clickbait is really really good at being compelling. I mean, it’s hard not to click on [Diddy Trial's Most Disturbing Claims: Week Three Breakdown](https://toofab.com/2025/05/27/diddy-trial-most-disturbing-claims-week-3-breakdown/) but clickbait often lacks real substance (step 2). This is why we call it clickbait and not good writing (but it sure as hell is compelling!)

ChatGPT is actually really good at this. Look at this. I asked ChatGPT to clickbaitify the title of this blog post and damn it did a great job. If these were youtube thumbnails I would click on them:
