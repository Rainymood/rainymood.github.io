Unorganized list of important lessons:

* Talk in terms of **needs** (What do you need? What do I need? What does the team need)
* Always communicate **next steps** (What do you propose?)
* Ask yourself: What be done in parrallel? What must be done in sequence?
* What is the total system complexity that must be managed?
* Complexity = dependencies + obscurities
* Split systems based on information and design assumptions and not on the order of the steps
* What are the edge cases?
* What tests do I need to write to prove that this works
* How can I shorten my feedback loop?
* How can I start from a place of sanity?
* How can I reproduce this locally?
* What do you hate most about work and how can you run towards it and embrace it?
* Long-lived feature branches suck
* What is the correct abstraction here?
* Ask for timelines
* Try to understand
* Ask for the trade-offs made here
* What needs to be de-risked first?
* You work best in the morning
* Ask clarifying questions
* Online you should communicate with ultra-high context
* Reliability, scalability, maintainability
* Don't delegate mission critical work, if you do, be on top of it
* Ask yourself: Does this problem need solving?
* Give feedback in the situation, behaviour, impact format
* People get sick and go on vacation, plan accordingly
* Have something to cross off
* In meetings share context and why we are here
* To learn test yourself
* To learn use spaced repetition
* Use dependency inversion
* Use hexagonal architecture
* Solve the problem in the domain space
* For production outages: get everyone on a call, lead with impact and next steps:w
