I'm actually a bit ashamed of making this post, but this is a very clear example of how procrastination can be harmful.

When I moved in I noticed a tiny bit of mold in the corner of my room. I did notice this little spot and decided to ignore it because it was very very tiny. That was over 2 years ago. 

Earlier today we were inspecting other things in our house and then someone pointed out like, wow, this is spot is actually quite big now. 

I was shocked and surprised at the same time. The spot had grown significantly larger. I think both due to the weather and the fact that my room is badly insulated which makes it both humid and cold at the same time. 

Anyway, it took all but one person to point out like: "Wow, you should really fix this. This is pretty bad for your health." And then I felt really bad and ashamed about it because **I procrastinated in a way that was actively harmful to my physical health** .

Once pointed out, the problem was kind of hard to ignore after that. 

So I fixed it. 

This is a very clear example of how procrastination was harming my health, but what if my procrastination is similarly harming my career?

**What are the things that I'm doing right now in my career that are actively harmful?** What things should I really stop doing because they're holding me back? What are the urgent problems that I need to solve now? And who is the person that's going to point that out to me? 

## Bonus: before/after pictures

If you want to see a neat but a bit gross before and after pictures of the mold, scroll down. I did pixelate it a bit so it is less gross.

Ready?
