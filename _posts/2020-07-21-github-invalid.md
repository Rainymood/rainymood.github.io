You're coding. You're in the flow. You're banging code out at the speed of
light. You're building the software that is going to change the world. You
`git add` and `git commit`. You're on fire. You're unstoppable. You're
hackerman.

Then you try to `git push`

```bash
 ➜  git push
Username for 'https://github.com': Rainymood
Password for 'https://Rainymood@github.com':
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Rainymood/foobar.git/'
```

What the hell?

# Everyone, PANIC! 

What the hell just happened? 

Honestly, I have no idea what just happened and why it happened. All I know
is that I've had this problem before and that my credentials sometimes
randomly just start failing when they feel like it.

Now you have to gather the last remaining pieces of self-worth you can find
around you on the floor and bash your head against a wall again to figure out
what the fuck went wrong and how to fix it.

# Step 1: Your username

First, we have to figure out what your user name is.

Let's consult `git config` to figure out your user name.

```bash
 ➜  git config user.name
Jan Meppe
```

WRONG! 

This is **not** your username. *This* is your user name.

# Step 2: Your password

Second, we need to figure out your password. 

If you are not a savage and use a password manager you can find your password
for Github there.

<img src="/assets/2020-07-21-github-invalid/img2.png">

WRONG! AGAIN! 

This is **not** your password. If at some point in the past, you used this
thing called a *personal access token*, then *that token* is your password.
But you probably forgot about that, didn't you? (I for sure fucking did.)

Go to **Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens**

<img src="/assets/2020-07-21-github-invalid/img4.png">

Basically if you use any scripts that have this token hardcoded somewhere in
there will be absolutely fucked. Thankfully, I'm not such an idiot (I hope).

Regenerate the token for this particular device.

And now **this is your password**

# Moment of truth 

We have our correct user name and correct password (personal access token).
Let's try this shit again.

```
 ➜  git push
Username for 'https://github.com': Rainymood
Password for 'https://Rainymood@github.com':

```

YEEEEEES!!! IT WORKS!

This is what it feels to be in a love-hate relationship with an inanimate
thing. Stupid fucking git I hate you. At the same time you work seamlessly
100% of the time 60% of the time.

Stupid silly git.

# Update: Still getting asked for your credentials every time?

If you are, even after all this trouble, still getting asked for your
credentials, follow along!

First, delete the current credentials explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/updating-credentials-from-the-osx-keychain#updating-your-credentials-via-keychain-access)

```
$ git credential-osxkeychain erase
host=github.com
protocol=https
> [Press Return]
```

Then, follow the steps outlined
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52428365/osxkeychain-is-not-storing-github-credentials).

Do you see this little `lock` icon? 

<img src="/assets/2020-07-21-github-invalid/lock1.png">

Right click on it and make sure it is `locked`. 

<img src="/assets/2020-07-21-github-invalid/lock2.png">

Finally, if you now try to push or pull you will be prompted to fill in your computer password. 

<img src="/assets/2020-07-21-github-invalid/creds.png">

Done! Your credentials are now stored. All is well now.
