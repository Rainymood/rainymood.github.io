* In this tweet we see how people initially disliked the now historic Wright brother's initial flight. It's easy to be negative and to be an armchair critic. No matter what you do, if it is of any significance you will find people that are critical. So best expect it and be ready for it. 

* Product: That being said, criticism can also be used as a tool to refine ideas and to make them stronger by having them stand up to scrutiny. There will always be some criticism, but maybe you can use it to make your ideas stronger and more resilient. 

* Org: Organizations must make decisions. Oftentimes this can be done in a democratic way in a group setting, but sometimes a leader must make bold and unpopular decisions. Then it is your choice. Do you listen to the criticism or do you continue regardless of what others say?
