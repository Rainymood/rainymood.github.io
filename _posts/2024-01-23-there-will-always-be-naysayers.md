**Introduction**

In this tweet, or now X, we see how people initially disliked the Wright brothers historic flight. It's easy to be negative and be an armchair critic. No matter what you do, people will always be critical of you, so best expect it and be ready for it.

**Personal reminder**

Resistance to change is common and often wrapped in skepticism. This story is a reminder for me to keep going despite doubts that others might have. Resistance is just part of the journey. Don't be scared of what others think because they will think it regardless. There will always be naysayers.

**Crafting better products**

Criticism can be used like a tool to refine ideas and make them strong enough to stand up to scrutiny. There will always be some initial resistance to new ideas and change, because that's the way people are. 

**Building better organizations**

Organizations face decisions, sometimes this must be done in a group arrangement in a democratic setting and other times you must make bold decisions yourself which can be seen as leaps of faith. Embrace the criticism and most of all expect it regardless of what you do.
