Today I want to introduce you to the concept of Infinity Pools.

> Infinity Pools are apps and other sources of endlessly replenishing content. If
you can pull to refresh, it’s an Infinity Pool. If it streams, it’s an Infinity
Pool. This always-available, always-new entertainment is your reward for the
exhaustion of constant busyness.

Infinity Pools are the reason that you feel so distracted and unfocused. These Infinity Pools are predatory products that compete for every second of our waking attention. They are backed by thousands of hours of research on human psychology and exploit our social nature to make sure that we spend more time on them.

Think of the apps that you waste the most time on, you’ll see that these are all infinity pools:

Instagram? Infinity pool.

Twitter? Infinity pool.

Facebook? Infinity pool.

Reddit? Infinity pool.

Netflix? Infinity pool.

Just like quicksand and whirlpools, these Infinity Pools are dangerous. If you skirt too close to the edge you get sucked in, and once you’re in it’s incredibly hard to get out. It’s best to avoid them as much as possible if you can, because you’re in constant danger of being sucked in.
