In this blog post I will show you how to add a simple teaser image to the
"You may also like" section of the [minimal
mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) Jekyll theme.
Adding a teaser image is super simple, but for some reason I spent way
more time on it than I would like to admit. 

## Before

## How to add a teaser image

Adding a teaser image in minimal mistakes is easy, you just have to change
the front matter of your post by adding a header and teaser tag

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Rainymood/b8fcbfb82949a188d31ceccf95ce1819.js"></script>

<!-- ```YAML
header: 
  teaser: "/path/to/image.png"
``` -->

For example, the front matter of this post looks like this. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Rainymood/2b58c32c9efc7e6b329128fe6a4344f4.js"></script>

## Conclusion

Adding teaser images in minimal mistakes is deceptively simple, you just need
to know what to change. For some reason I was not able to figure it out and
had to ask someone myself.

With this short and simple blog post I hope to help someone with the same
burning question as me: "How do I add teaser images to minimal mistakes?"
