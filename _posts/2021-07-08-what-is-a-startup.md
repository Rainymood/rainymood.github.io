This is my summary of the [Startup = Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) essay by Paul Graham.
Much of the sentences are lifted ad verbatim so they can't really be considered my own words. It's more of a condensed version with some minor tweaks.

# Growth

**Remember this!** A startup is a company that is designed to grow fast.
{: .notice--primary}

What is a startup? **A startup is a company that is designed to grow fast.** Not every new company is a startup. Neither is a startup required to work on new technology, although it often appears to be that way. Nor is a startup required to take on venture funding, although they often do. 

The only thing that matters for a startup is **growth**. Everything that pops to
mind when we think of startups, the flashy offices, fast growth, IPOs, equity
grants, etc. can all be derived from its growth. 

A startup is, and should be, chasing growth. If you are not chasing growth you
are most likely not working at a startup. On the flip side, if you can achieve
and sustain the growth week over week, then all other pieces will tend to fall
into place.

Not every company is a startup. A barbershop is not a startup. On the other
hand, [Retool](https://retool.com/), a SaaS startup providing software to build
internal company tools, is a startup. How can we tell? Well in 4 years time they
grew to a valuation of a billion dollars:

> Retool, Inc., a startup that’s less than four years old, is worth almost $1 billion after raising money from some of Silicon Valley’s top investors including [Sequoia Capital](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/18308Z:US) and executives from [GitHub Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0560908D:US) and [Stripe Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0170016D:US)

Can you imagine a barbershop becoming worth more than a billion dollars in less
than 4 years time? Yeah neither can I. Startups are *different*. And the only
thing that matters for them is *growth*.

# Ideas

**Remember this!** How can you scratch your own itch?
{: .notice--primary}

Say you want to start a startup. How do you come up with a good idea for a
startup? One way could be to try ideas that others have overlooked. But there is
a better way of coming up with ideas. Using modern technology, scratch your own
itch.

Technology moves fast. In fact, it moves so fast that formerly bad ideas can
quickly turn into good ideas without anyone noticing. We used to teach our kids
not to get into a stranger's car, but look at Uber! 

Anyway, Steve Wozniak scratched his own itch by building his own computer:

> Steve Wozniak's problem was that he wanted his own computer. That was an unusual problem to have in 1975. But technological change was about to make it a much more common one. Because he not only wanted a computer but knew how to build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one. And the problem he solved for himself became one that Apple solved for millions of people in the coming years. But by the time it was obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market, Apple was already established.

And so did Larry Page and Sergey Brin by building their own search engine: 

> Google has similar origins. Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to search the web. But unlike most people they had the technical expertise both to notice that existing search engines were not as good as they could be, and to know how to improve them. Over the next few years their problem became everyone's problem, as the web grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert to notice the old algorithms weren't good enough. But as happened with Apple, by the time everyone else realized how important search was, Google was entrenched.

Both the Apple founders and Google founders scratched their own itch by solving
their own problems. By the time the competition started noticing, it was already
too late and they were forced to play catchup. What problems are you facing that
you can uniquely solve using modern technology? 



# Growth rate

**Remember this!** Try to grow 5% to 7% week over week. Measure revenue or active users.
{: .notice--primary}

How fast does a company need to grow to considered to be a startup? 

A startup growth has three phases. 

> 1. There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing.
> 2. As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid growth.
> 3. Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company. Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves. [5]

The slope for the 2nd phase is it's growth rate. This is what every founder should know. This is the measure of our success of a startup.  If you don't know this number you don't know. 

> The slope is the company's growth rate. If there's one number every founder should always know, it's the company's growth rate. That's the measure of a startup. If you don't know that number, you don't even know if you're doing well or badly.

Measure growth rate per week.

> During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week, partly because there is so little time before Demo Day, and partly because startups early on need frequent feedback from their users to tweak what they're doing. [6]

5%-7% per week is a good growth rate for a startup.

> A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. If you can hit 10% a week you're doing exceptionally well. If you can only manage 1%, it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.

The best measure is revenue. The other best measure is active users. 

> The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue. The next best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users. That's a reasonable proxy for revenue growth because whenever the startup does start trying to make money, their revenues will probably be a constant multiple of active users. [7]

# Compass

**Remember this!** Use your growth target as a compass. Pick a target and hit it every week. Did you hit your growth goals for the week?
{: .notice--primary}

Pick a growth rate that you think you can hit and hit it every week.  This turns
your startup into an optimization problem which you can solve. What do you have
to do this week to hit that growth target? 

You can use your growth rate as a compass for your decisions. In essence, everything you do boils down to a single problem: Will this make us hit our growth target this week?
(This reminds me of [will this make the boat go faster](https://willitmaketheboatgofaster.com/).)

This also means that you do not look more than one week into the future. Now you might think to yourself, but I'm not looking forward enough now. But this is not the case, you are thinking about the future, just not more than necessary.

Having such a clear and defined growth goal forces you to act. And acting versus
not acting is the most crucial factor for startups. Often times sitting around
and thinking about what to do is just a form of intellectual
procrastination. 

Note that because you are chasing growth that your company will most likely morph into something than what you intially imagined. And that is a good thing. I claim that something that grows at a steady rate of 5%-7% a week is more valuable than your initial idea. 

Follow this growth constraint instead of clinging on to your first idea. This is a bit like a scientist following the results of his experiments rather than trying to force the experiment to succumb to what he wishes the results would be. 

Richard Feynman once said that imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man. Just keep following the truth and you'll come up with cooler shit than you could ever imagine.

# Value

**Remember this!** If you grow 5% every week, you will more than 10x in a year.
{: .notice--primary}

If you find something that grows at an exponential rate, cling onto it like your
life depends on it. To find out why, look at this graph:

| weekly | yearly |
|--------|--------|
| 1%     | 1.7x   |
| 2%     | 2.8x   |
| 5%     | 12.6x  |
| 7%     | 33.7x  |
| 10%    | 142.0x |

This graph translates a steady weekly growth rate into a yearly one.  A company
that grows at 1% each week grows 1.7x a year.  On the other hand, A company that
grows at 5% each week grows 12.6x a year! What a difference!  If you are making
1000 a month now and grow at a rate of 5% a week you'll be making 25 million a
month in 4 years.

Sounds implausible? Yes. But that's because our intuitions about exponential
growth suck. This is also assuming that you can really achieve this growth
target week over week. That's more than 200 weeks of constant sustained
exponential growth.

This concludes the first part of the summary. In the next part I'll talk about why investors like startups and why they get acquired.
