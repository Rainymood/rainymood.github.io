This is my summary of the [Startup = Growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html) essay by Paul Graham. Much of the sentences are lifted ad verbatim so they can't really be considered my own words. Enjoy!

# Growth

**Remember this!** A startup is a company that is designed to grow fast.

Let's jump right in! What makes a startup a startup? **A startup is a company that is designed to grow fast.** This means that not every new company is a startup, nor that a startup has to work on new and exciting technology, although they often go hand in hand. 

The only thing that matters for a startup is **growth**. Everything that pops to
mind when we think of startups (tech-based product, catered food, flashy offices, massages, bring your dog to work days, stocks, IPOs, etc.) can all be derived from a startup's growth.

A startup is, and should be, chasing growth. If you are not chasing growth you
are most likely not working at a startup. However, if you can sustain rapid
growth week over week, all the other pieces will tend to fall into place.

Let me show you what I mean with *growth*. Consider your regular local
barbershop. That's not a startup. Now consider for example this company, 
[Retool](https://retool.com/), a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company creating
software to build internal company tools, which *is* a startup.  How can we
tell? Well in 4 years they grew to a valuation of [a billion dollars](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-20/retool-nears-1-billion-valuation-with-funding-from-sequoia):

> Retool, Inc., a startup that’s less than four years old, is worth almost $1 billion after raising money from some of Silicon Valley’s top investors including [Sequoia Capital](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/18308Z:US) and executives from [GitHub Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0560908D:US) and [Stripe Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0170016D:US)

Can you imagine a barbershop becoming worth more than a billion dollars in less
than 4 years time? Yeah neither can I. Startups are *different*, and the only
thing that matters for them is *growth*.

# Ideas

**Remember this!** Don't actively search for startup ideas, scratch your own itch.

"OK. I get it," you now mumble to yourself. A startup is all about growth. How
do you come up with an idea that you can grow?  One way could be to try ideas
that others have overlooked. But there is a better way of coming up with ideas:
scratch your own itch.

Because the world of technology moves so fast, formerly bad ideas can quickly
turn into good idea without anyone noticing. This is how most startups get
started. The founders felt the pain of a particular problem and were able to
solve it with technology that just became available to the masses. Apple
co-founder Steve Wozniak scratched his own itch of wanting a personal computer:

> Steve Wozniak's problem was that he wanted his own computer. That was an
unusual problem to have in 1975. But technological change was about to make it a
much more common one. Because he not only wanted a computer but knew how to
build them, Wozniak was able to make himself one. And the problem he solved for
himself became one that Apple solved for millions of people in the coming years.
But by the time it was obvious to ordinary people that this was a big market,
Apple was already established.

And so did the Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, of wanting a better search engine:

> Google has similar origins. Larry Page and Sergey Brin wanted to search the
web. But unlike most people they had the technical expertise both to notice that
existing search engines were not as good as they could be, and to know how to
improve them. Over the next few years their problem became everyone's problem,
as the web grew to a size where you didn't have to be a picky search expert to
notice the old algorithms weren't good enough. But as happened with Apple, by
the time everyone else realized how important search was, Google was entrenched.

Both the Apple founders and Google founders scratched their own itch, solving
their own problems.  By the time the competition started noticing, it was
already too late. So think to yourself: What itch you can scratch?

# Growth rate

**Remember this!** Try to grow revenue or active users 5% to 7% week over week.
{: .notice--primary}

How fast does a company need to grow to considered to be a startup? 

Startup growth can be divided into three phases: 

> 1. There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing.
> 2. As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid growth.
> 3. Eventually a successful startup will grow into a big company. Growth will slow, partly due to internal limits and partly because the company is starting to bump up against the limits of the markets it serves. [5]

The slope in the second phase is your growth rate. This is what every founder
should know. This is the measure of success for your startup. If you don't know
this number you don't know how well you are doing as a startup. Startups should
aim to grow at 5% to 7% per week.

So what growth should you measure? The best metric you want to track is revenue,
if you can't do that, track active users: 

> The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue. The next best, for
startups that aren't charging initially, is active users. That's a reasonable
proxy for revenue growth because whenever the startup does start trying to make
money, their revenues will probably be a constant multiple of active users.

# Compass

**Remember this!** Use your growth target as a guide for your decisions. Will
*this make me hit my growth targets?
{: .notice--primary}

![](/../assets/2021-07-08-what-is-a-startup/2021-07-12-14-39-09.png)

You can use this growth rate as a compass for your decisions. Pick a growth rate
that you think you can hit and try to hit it every week. This turns every
decision you make into a much simpler problem: what do you need to do to hit
your growth target? (This actually reminds me of [will this make the boat go faster](https://willitmaketheboatgofaster.com/).)

Having such a clearly defined growth goal forces you to act. And often acting
versus not-acting is the most crucial factor for startup success. Often times
sitting around and thinking about what to do is just another form of
procrastination.

Keep in mind that, because you are chasing growth, your company will most likely
morph into something else than you initially had in mind. This is a good thing.
Something that grows 5% to 7% steadily every week is much more valuable than
what you conjured up initially. 

Follow this growth constraint instead of clinging to your initial idea of what
the company should look like. Compare yourself with a scientist following the
results of his experiment, rather than trying to force the results of the
experiments to what he wishes them to be. 

Richard Feynman once said that imagination of nature is greater than the
imagination of man, and I think so too. Just keep following your growth and
you'll come up with cooler stuff than you could ever imagine. 

# Value

**Remember this!** If you grow 5% every week, you will more than 10x in a year.
{: .notice--primary}

![](/../assets/2021-07-08-what-is-a-startup/2021-07-12-14-39-44.png)

If you find something that grows at an exponential rate, cling onto it like your
life depends on it. To find out why, look at this graph:

| weekly | yearly |
|--------|--------|
| 1%     | 1.7x   |
| 2%     | 2.8x   |
| 5%     | 12.6x  |
| 7%     | 33.7x  |
| 10%    | 142.0x |

This graph translates a weekly growth into a yearly growth. A company
that grows 1% each week, grows at 1.7x in a year. A company that
grows 5% each week, grows 12.6x in a year! 

Sounds implausible? Yes. The reason for that is because our intuitions about
exponential growth *suck*. This is why it is so important for a startup to keep
growing and growing. Do everything in your might and power to sustain this
growth. That's what makes a startup a startup, growth.

# Summary

* A startup is a company that is designed to grow fast.
* Don’t actively search for startup ideas, scratch your own itch.
* Try to grow revenues (or active users) 5% to 7% week over week (more than 10x in a year)
