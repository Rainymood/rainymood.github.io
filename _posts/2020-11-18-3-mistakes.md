Today I want to share with you three mistakes that I made. 

I'm sharing these mistakes to learn from them and to give you a bit a glimpse
of what my day-to-day looks like as a software engineer.

# 🤓 What's the context? 

I am currently part of a team that is building a facebook chatbot using
[Node.js]() and [Google Dialogflow](). We use [Chatbase]() for analytics and
I'm in charge of building the integration of Chatbase with our Node backend.

# ⛔️ Mistake 1: Returning something else than I thought

The first mistake that I made: I returned something else than I thought.

*This* is wrong. 

```js
const addUserMessage = (userMessage) => {
    const set = chatbase.newMessageSet();

    // Add user message to set 
    return set.newMessage()
              .setMessage(userMessage);
}
```

*This* is right. 

```js
const addUserMessage = (userMessage) => {
    const set = chatbase.newMessageSet();

    // Add user message to set 
    set.newMessage()
       .setMessage(userMessage);

    return set
}
```

The function `addUserMessage` is supposed to return the `newMessageSet` from
the variable `set`. However, the method `set.newMessage()` doesn't return the
`set()`, but the actual message that was being set!

✅ Know what you're returning!

# ⛔️ Mistake 2: A subtle typo

The second mistake was stupid typo which took me way too long to find. 

```js
const receivedMessage = async event => {
    const senderID = event.sender.id;
    const message = event.message;
    const messageId = message.mid;

    const chatbaseMessageSet = chatbaseConnector.createMessageSet(senderID, senderId, messageId, message);

    ...
}
```

Can you spot the mistake?

I just realized that we are very inconsistent with our spelling, using both
`ID` *and* `Id`. Very confusing.

✅ Be consistent with your grammar!

# ⛔️ Mistake 3: My object turned into a int?

The third and final mistake was that I didn't realise the function I was working on was being called somewhere incorrectly. 

the function was being called incorrect of the day was that I didn't realise the function was being called with too much (wrong) arguments somewhere.

This is what I thought the function looked like when I started working on it.

```js
const dialogFlowResponseHandler = async (sender, response) => {
  ...
};
```

So I added another parameter to the function like so.

```js
const dialogFlowResponseHandler = async (sender, response, chatbaseMessageSet) => {
  ...
};
```

Little did I know that somewhere else in the code this function was being called 

```js
const dialogFlowResponseHandler = async (sender, response, userId) => {
  ...
};
```

Which had the nice benefit of turning the intended `chatbaseMessageSet` into
a nice integer every time that function was called, crashing the app!

✅ Double check where the functions are being called that you are working on!

# 🔮 Recap

Today I made some silly mistakes. The good thing is that we can learn from these. 

👇 Three lessons

* Know what you're returning.
* Be on the lookout for silly typos. 
* Double check the code that you're working on.
