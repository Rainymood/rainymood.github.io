Experiencing pregnancy up close is so much different than experiencing it second hand. What it also made me realize is that being pregnant is a problem (sort of) that has a very specific time frame. 

And just like that, I realized that actually **all human problems are timely**.

### death

Most of humankind's problems are man-made--without humans, there would be no problems. Now, imagine we take a "typical" human who lives from birth to the age of 100. All the problems they experience exist exclusively within this specific tiem span. Let's put it on a timeline like so:

### taxes

Now. There are two things certain in life: death and taxes. For illustrative purposes I’ll remove the death and focus on the taxes. Imagine a human starts paying taxes at 18 and stops paying taxes when he dies at age 100, that would look something like this:

Just like paying taxes, all problems have a very specific timeframe. All problems are isolated into a very specific time window in our life! And it sounds trivial, and it is, but it is a key insight that we should tailor our solutions to very specific niches, also in time!

### being pregnant

The most obvious and extreme example is being pregnant! You become pregnant for 9 months and then you have an extremely specific set of problems. Then hopefully you give birth to a healthy baby and *poof* just like snow before sun your pregnancy problems disappear (sort-of).

### finding a coworking spot in vienna

A while ago I was visiting Vienna and had my first online meeting at 9:00. At 8:30 I was walking from my hotel to the city center, but I had a pressing and somewhat urgent problem: finding a good café to do some remote work in. For those 30 minutes, and I did find a nice café in some online directory, I had this specific and timely problem. I find that this example highlights the timeliness of our problems.

### end

All problems are timely, so design solutions with this specific time frame in mind. It's OK if users outgrow your solution because that means your solution is well-tailored to a specific user niche. Bonus points if you incorporate the [Lindy Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect).
