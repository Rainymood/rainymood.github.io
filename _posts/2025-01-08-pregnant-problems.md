So, someone close to me is pregnant right now and I realized that being pregnant is a problem (sort of) that has a very specific time duration. And just like that, I realized that actually **all human problems are timely**.

Most of humankind’s problems are man made, without humans, no problems. So imagine we take a "normal" (meaning standard) human that lives from age 0 to age 100m, then it is exactly in this time span that this person has problems. Let’s put it on a timeline like so:

Now. There are two things certain in life: death and taxes. For illustrative purposes I’ll remove the death and focus on the taxes. Imagine a human starts paying taxes at 18 and stops paying taxes until he dies at age 100, that would look something like this:

Just like paying taxes, all problems have a very specific timeframe. All problems are isolated into a very specific time window in our life! And it sounds trivial, and it is, but it is a key insight that we should tailor our solutions to very specific niches, also in time!

The most obvious and extreme example is being pregnant! You become pregnant for 9 months and then you have an extremely specific set of problems. Then hopefully you give birth to a healthy baby and *poof* just like snow before sun your pregnancy problems disappear (sort-of).

Another example: At some point I was in Vienna and at 8:30 with my first meeting starting at 9:00 I had exactly 30 minutes to search online for a a nice café to do some remote work in. At that point in time for those 30 minutes I had an extremely specific problem that required a solution: find me a good space to do some remote work in. This problem was again, timely, extremely timely even!

Realize that all problems are timely and that we should design our solution for that. It should be possible for your user to outgrow your solution (also in time) because this means that your solution is well-tailored to this specific user niche.
