In this blogpost I tackle [Leetcode problem 378](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/submissions/) on finding the first unique character in a string.

## The problem

The problem is defined as follows: 

**Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.**

With some example input and output

```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```

## General strategy

I first tried to go with a brute force strategy, but intuitively already felt the need for a hashmap type of solution. 

I found out that getting the brute force algorithm to work was too much effort and the hashmap solution that I intuited turned out to be very quick and elegant. 

## Brute force solution

In pseudocode: 

* Start at the beginning and take the character
* Loop for every other character in the array and check if it is the same
	* If character is not the same, it is unique, return index
	* If character is the same, go to next

This was my first solution 

```python
def firstUniqChar(: str) -> int:     
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        unique = True
        for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
          # loop through all other characters
          # if character is no match for all of them we found a unique one
          # if character does match, not unique, continue with next
          # print(f"Comparing {s[i]} with {s[j]} ")
          if s[i] == s[j]:
            unique = False
        if unique == True:
          return i
      # No unique chars found
    return -1 
```

This failed on a test case with a single character input, say `z` which shouldve returned `0` of course. We can fix this with a simple rule:

```python
def firstUniqChar(s: str) -> int:
    if len(s)==1: 
        return 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        unique = True
        for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
          # loop through all other characters
          # if character is no match for all of them we found a unique one
          # if character does match, not unique, continue with next
          print(f"Comparing {s[i]} with {s[j]} ")
          if s[i] == s[j]:
            unique = False

        if unique == True:
          return i
      # No unique chars found
    return -1  
```

This fails on another test case `aadadaad`, this is because it does not keep track that the `a` is already seen. We make another list that we call `seen` and keep track of the things we've seen already. Darned,  this also fails on another test case:

```python
def firstUniqChar(s: str) -> int:
    seen = []
    if len(s)==1: 
        return 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        unique = True
        for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
          # loop through all other characters
          # if character is no match for all of them we found a unique one
          # if character does match, not unique, continue with next
          print(f"Comparing {s[i]} with {s[j]} ")
          if s[i] == s[j] or s[i] in seen:
            unique = False
        seen.append(s[i])
        if unique == True:
          return i
      # No unique chars found
    return -1  
```

This one fails on the test case where the unique character is the last one. 

At this point I was almost willing to give up the brute force solution. It turned out to be significantly more difficult than I expected. I decided to throw my whole solution out and started with a blank slate. 

```python
def firstUniqChar(s: str) -> int:
  # Edge case s is single character
  if len(s) == 1: 
    return 0
  seen = []
  for i in range(len(s)):
    unique = True
    # Edge case where last char is unique one
    if i==len(s)-1:
      if s[i] in seen:
        return -1
      if s[i] not in seen: 
        return i
    for j in range(i+1, len(s)):
      # print(i, j, s[i])
      if s[i] == s[j] or s[i] in seen: 
        unique = False
    seen.append(s[i])
    if unique == True: 
      return i
  # No unique chars found
  return -1
```

I built this monstrosity and then... it timed out. 

It was too slow. 

I already realised that my solution would run in quadratic time but didn't expect it to actually timeout. Oh well, on to the hashmap solution then. 

## Hashmap solution

<img src="/assets/2020-04-01-leetcode/image2.png">

To solve this problem we use a so-called hashmap. 

The basic idea is to go through the whole string once and to keep track (in a hashmap/dictionary) the things we've seen already. 

```python
def firstUniqChar(s: str) -> int:
  seen = []
  saved = {}
  i = 0
  for c in s:
    if c in seen: 
      saved.pop(c, None)
    else:
      saved[c] = i
    seen.append(c)
    i = i+1
  # Return smallest index or return -1 if no unique
  if saved: 
    return min(saved.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[1]
  else: 
    return -1
```

In pseudocode: 

* Keep track a list of seen characters `seen = ['a', 'b', ...]`
* Keep track of uniques `saved = {'a': 1, ...}`
* Loop through string once: 
    * If we see a duplicate, remove from `saved`
    * If we see a new character, save it in `saved`
    * Update `seen`
* Once done, return either smallest index in `saved` or `-1` if `saved` is empty

Quick, elegant, concise.

## Lessons learned

Getting the solution right took me longer than expected, it took me a solid morning to get this question right. This just shows how untrained and unprepared my brain is for these challenges, hopefully I can improve in the future. 

Two main lessons: 

* Lesson 1. The hashmap is a super powerful generalisation. Keep your eye open for problems that you can solve using a hashmap type of solution.
* Lesson 2. Do not forget about edge cases. Especially in the brute force one I had to hardcode many edge cases. Annoying, but a necessary part of programming.
