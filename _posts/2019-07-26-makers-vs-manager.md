It's well known that programmers dislike meetings... *a lot*. But have
you ever wondered why programmers dislike meetings so much compared to
other people? The answer is simple but obvious once pointed out:
meetings are more costly to them.

I'm sure many programmers can relate to this comic.

This blog is about the two stick figures from the comic: the maker and
the manager and the fundamental problem that occurs when their
schedules meet.

Note: Much of the content of this blog post is borrowed from
[this](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) essay by Paul
Graham. It was written in July 2009, more than 10 years ago!  If you
can find the time I highly recommend the original essay, it's a
classic.

## Takeaway

**For managers:**
- Understand that the cost of an interruption is significantly higher
  for makers than for managers.
- The next time you want to interrupt a programmer deep in thought,
  think of the comic.

**For makers:**
- Understand that managers operate on a different day-to-day schedule than you
do and respect that.
- Clearly communicate that you need long stretches of uninterrupted
  time to deliver great work, but be willing to compromise.

## Maker's schedule, manager's schedule

In his essay, Graham argues that there are two different types of
schedules, which he calls the **maker's schedule** and the **manager's schedule**.

The manager's schedule can be thought of the traditional calendar. The
day is neatly sliced into hours.  You can schedule more than 1 hour
for an appointment or meeting but by default you can switch tasks
every hour or 30 minutes.

The maker's schedule is different. The maker's schedule is for
programmers and writers who prefer longer stretches of uninterrupted
time. For a writer or programmer it takes time to get started, it is
difficult to produce something truly valuable in half an hour.

For people on the maker's schedule, ill-planned meetings come with a
cost that is both high and not immediately obvious. **A single meeting
can ruin a whole morning by breaking up a long period into just short
enough periods where exactly nothing of value can be produced.**
Meetings are like the interruptions from the comic, but on a macro
level.

Consider a single meeting from 10:00-11:00.

The programmer dutifully arrives at the office at 9:00. After the
daily stand-up it's 9:15 and now he has exactly 45 minutes to get
some programming done. But he knows that he has a meeting at 10 so
he will probably not be able to program until 10:00 exactly because of
the meeting. It's 9:30 already, shit. I'd better prepare for the
meeting. Of course, the meeting is scheduled to 11:00 but runs
slightly longer and after the meeting you grab a coffee with your
coworkers. Now it's 11:15 and you have 45 minutes to lunch. The
programmer now has to decide whether he is going to spend 20
minutes getting into the flow to spend a mere 25 minutes
programming until lunchtime.

Narrator: *He didn't.*

The problem is that most powerful people are on the manager's
schedule. That's the reason it's called the manager's schedule. Your
manager (your boss) is most likely, without realizing it, on the
manager's schedule. This is also why its more likely that the maker
will conform to the manager's schedule, he is your boss after all.

This is the crux of the whole problem. Two different types of people
with two different types of schedules. The problem is clear, but what
about solutions?

Graham offers three solutions. The first one is using office hours to
simulate a manager's schedule inside a maker's schedule.

> How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule?
> By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule
> within the maker's: office hours. Several times a week I set aside a
> chunk of time to meet founders we've funded. These chunks of time are
> at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program that
> ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours are
> clustered at the end. Because they come at the end of my day these
> meetings are never an interruption.

The second solution comes from Graham's personal experience, but I
doubt that this is sustainable in any other environment than a
start-up.

> When we were working on our own startup, back in the 90s, I evolved
> another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner
> till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt
> me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner
> on what I called "business stuff." I never thought of it in these
> terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's
> schedule and one on the maker's.

For the third solution we continue to the closing remarks.

## Closing remarks

It feels incredibly lazy to simply copy Graham's words again, but they
still ring true today, ten years later.

> Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source of
> the problem. We just took it for granted that we had to either blow
> our schedules or offend people. But now that I've realized what's
> going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something
> explaining the two types of schedule. Maybe eventually, if the
> conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule
> starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a problem.

This is the third solution: hope and optimism. To write something
clearly explaining the problem and then hoping it goes away on its
own. Wishful thinking, but good wishful thinking nonetheless.  In
writing this essay I've been perhaps just as naive as Graham himself
by believing in the idea that if we can show people the problem that it
vanishes into thin air - exactly like the programmer's deep
thoughts when interrupted.

It is said that time reveals the truth and maybe, just maybe, we can
do more about it in the coming ten years.
