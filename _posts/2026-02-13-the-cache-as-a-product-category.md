The cache as a product is a product category of its own.

Product ideas can be deceptively simple.

The cache as a product stores a finished good of something and makes it instantly available with the press of a single button or a single click.

### Example 1: Quooker

For example this is a quooker. It gives you hot boiling water at the press of a single button with of course of safety mechanisms built in. This is a great example of a cash as a product. Replace the hot water boiler. I find it funny because we have one in my office and I do notice that I've actually drink more tea because of it.

### Example 2: Hot water dispenser

The previous example was actually a fairly new fairly Westernize version of the hot water dispenser you can find anywhere in Asia. It's the same thing you get hot water at the click of a button.

### Example 3: [Archive.ph](http://Archive.ph) (cached web pages)

Then there are different websites for example where you can archive webpage and then look at the archive version later. This is quite literally a webpage cache as a product.

### Why this works

So I found a product value framework laying somewhere around that it had to follow shape: We want to achieve an outcome times a certain likelihood over the time delay we get it time to effort we need to expend ourselves.

( Outcome x Likelihood ) / (Time delay x Effort) = Value

In this framework the cache as a product effectively makes the denominator (bottom of the equation) zero. It provides value by making making it instant (time delay = 0) and at the push of a button (effort = 0). 

**What other things can you now do instantly with the click of a button?**
