Tools are everywhere around us. Thanks to our smart (and lethal) tools (i.e. bow and
arrow) we have managed to box our way up to the top of the food chain. I
would even dare to argue that our tools are exactly what shape us as a human
species, but that's a story for another day. We use tools, we invent new
ones, and they become extensions of our very being.

This blog post dedicated to the definition of a tool. What is a tool? What
makes a good tool? And what does the second law of thermodynamics have to do
with it?

# What is a tool?

Let's start with the definition of a tool. 
For **my definition** of a tool I will use [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s definition from his essay [A brief rant on the future of interaction design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/). 

A tool addresses **human problems** by amplifying **human capabilities**.

# A great tool fits two sides

A tool is a thing that converts what we __can do__ (our capability) into
something we __want to do__ (solve a problem).

A great tool is designed to fit both sides. The hammerhead fits perfectly on
the problem (the nail we think needs driving in) and the handle fits
perfectly on the person that is going to use the tool.

# Redirecting force

I like this definition of a tool because it describes transforming our human
capabilities into something that we want to do. This definition is consistent
with the second law of thermodynamics which states that energy can not be
created nor destroyed. Thus, a tool can never create or destroy energy, it
can only redirect it.

Consider the humble axe. We transform rotational energy from our body into
the side of the blade. The total energy throughout the whole swing remains
the same, what matters is where we redirect the force to!

# Conclusion 

That's it! So what does this mean to you? Not much, really. I just urge you
to sometimes stop and think of this definition of a tool. Does the tool fit
the problem well? Does it fit the user's hands? Is force being redirected
efficiently? Can we improve the tool's head or handle?

Just to repeat: A tool addresses **human problems** by amplifying **human
capabilities**. A good tool fits these two parts well. On the one end the
tool should fit the problem, and on the other end it should fit the end user.
