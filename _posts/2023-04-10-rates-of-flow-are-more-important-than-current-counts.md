I recently read [this](https://two-wrongs.com/emptying-the-dishwasher-with-systems-theory.html) article and it really resonated with me. The central insight of this article is that you should invest time and energy in such a way that you have time working for you rather than against you. If you live in a household where the dishes pile and you want this fixed you can, for example, start trying to do all the work yourself, but this will only get you frustrated. What is a better idea is that you invest time and effort into *emptying* the dishwasher. People often don't mind putting their dirty dishes in the dishwasher if it is emptied and clean. However, if the dishwasher is full then of course you are going to put your dishes on the counter, where else, the dishwasher is full? If you invest a tiny bit of effort more in the right place (emptying the dishwasher) you can have time work for you (people put their dishes in) instead of against you (dishes keep piling up). 

Imagine you have a dishwasher situation at home where the dishes seem to be piling up faster than you can manage.

The article then argues that it makes most sense for you to invest your limited time in such a way that you make time work *for* you rather than *against* you. 

Most people don't mind putting their dishes at all in the dishwasher given that it is clean and empty

But if the dishwasher is full and you have to go, then where you put your dishes? On the counter of course. This makes sense. We all do this.

That is what the article argues.

The article now argues that *emptying the dishwasher* becomes a high leverage activity because it changes the relation of time and the system. 

Before time was working against you, the dishes kept piling up.

After emptying the dishwasher time is working for you, people put their dishes in the (now) empty dishwasher themselves
