Life updates

* Moved to Paris! I think that's the biggest one! My significant other found a job as a post-doc with her own hard-won grant in medicine and that made us make the move to Paris. I have to admit I'm adjusting to being fully remote, but it's a process! Learning the language at the A2.2 level. Of course, now being an expat for the first time I'll be experiencing all the expat things that everyone always talks about. I find the whole process of people getting fresh baguettes every day fascinating. The food here is top quality and a little bit cheaper than in The Netherlands.
* Got promoted to senior machine learning engineer! Of course a promotion like this is always a process that's in the making. Just like earning a blue belt in jiu jitsu it's something that should just be a formality if all things go well. However, I do feel even more responsibile now for correctly leveraging my time and skill into more high-leverage decisions.
* I have two cats now! So somewhere in this period I acquired two very beautiful cats. They can be a menace sometimes but they are very playful and we actually learned them some tricks. They are called Kuma (which means bear in japanese) and Neko (which means cat in japanese).

Things I'm watching right now:

* [Black mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror): New season 7 dropped and I'm about 3 episodes in so far. The first episode makes you cringe so hard your toenails will fall off. Especially combined with the first human trial of [neuralink](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/20/tech/first-neuralink-human-subject-computer-mouse-elon-musk/index.html). The second episode is very thrilling and the third episode is a real tear-jerker. I love all of them so far.

Books I'm super into right now:

* [The Mom Test](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=the+mom+test): This is a book that tells you how to talk to people and find out if your side project idea is worth pursuing or not. It's called the mom test because it makes people that would like to hurt your feelings (like your mom) unable to lie to you. A very condensed summary of the book is that you want to avoid mentioning your idea at all and instead talk about your user's life (problems, goals, limitations, frustrations).
* [When Coffee and Kale compete](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=when+coffee+and+kale+compete): This is a book that's kind of similar and it talks about how to frame your product both to yourself and to others. The goal of a product is to help someone in achieving a goal ("job to be done"). So your product should "upgrade" the user. Kale and coffee compete because they both upgrade the user in becoming a healther version of themselves.

We've really been on a quest to finding the best ramen in Paris. 

The absolute **best** ramen in Paris (so far):

* [Higuma](https://g.co/kgs/kybjY1e): Quite run down restaurant but the ramen is amazing and incredibly cheap, 10 euros for a bowl. Top right picture. 
* [Kodawari Ramen (Yokocho)](https://g.co/kgs/bN5z8ij): This is a cool restaurant where they try really embrace and simulate that japanese alleyway. It's small, chaotic, they even play like "road sounds" of cars and people talking. The broth is really good and umami and the noodles are firm and thick. There's often a very very large queue so if you go either early or at a time that is inconvenient you will have better luck. Bottom left picture.
