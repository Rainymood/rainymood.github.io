# Analogy

Analogy is at the core of cognition, according to Douglas Hofstadter. 

## Testing is like pulling up a bucket of water

> Ultimately, programming is hard. Often, we are smart, so we succeed. TDD is there to
help us out when we’re not so smart. Kent Beck (who basically invented TDD) uses the
metaphor of **lifting a bucket of water out of a well with a rope**: when the well isn’t too
deep, and the bucket isn’t very full, it’s easy. And even lifting a full bucket is pretty easy
at first. But after a while, you’re going to get tired. TDD is like having a ratchet that lets
you save your progress, take a break, and make sure you never slip backwards. That way
you don’t have to be smart all the time.

## Testing is like a vise

> Software Vise: "When we have tests that detect change, it is like **having a
vise around our code**. The behavior of the code is fixed in place. When we make
changes, we can know that we are changing only one piece of behavior at a time".

## Meetings should be like salt

> When meetings are the norm, the first resort, the go-to tool to discuss,
debate, and solve every problem, they become overused and we grow numb to the
outcome. **Meetings should be like salt**, sprinkled carefully to enhance a dish, not
poured recklessly over every forkful. Too much salt destroys a dish. Too many
meetings can destroy morale and motivation.
